# Website utilizing recursive inscriptions
This is my example of using resursive ordinal inscriptions to serve a basic website. It may be the first ever!


### > brandonmarshall-max.html was used for internal testing to build out the site

Once I verified everything was working on that level, I inscribed all the assets (WEBP and SVGs) and took note of each of their Inscription IDs.

From there, I created a new doc and replaced the static files with using /source/INSCRIPTIONID

I also minified the HTML file, which isn't required but removed unnecessary blank space to cut down on the file size and make it even cheaper to inscribe.

### > The actual HTML file I inscribed is brandonmarshal.html
